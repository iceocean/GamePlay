## gameplay-encoder
Command-line tool for encoding games assets like true-type fonts and 3D scene files
into a simple binary-based bundle file format for the gameplay 3D game framework runtime. 
The 'bin' folder contains pre-built versions of the gameplay-encoder executables for 
Windows 7, MacOS X and Linux Ubuntu 12 (32-bit) with support built-in support for:

## TrueType Font
TrueType Fonts represent a standard in defining outline fonts and has become the 
most common format for fonts. The gameplay-encoder reads these fonts and binary encodes 
them into a texture mapped base representation using a texture atlas and 8-bit alpha
representation.

## COLLADA Scene
COLLADA is a royalty-free XML schema that enables digital asset exchange 
within the interactive 3D industry. Most major 3D DCC tools support export to COLLADA 1.4.

## FBX Scene
Autodesk® FBX® asset exchange technology facilitates higher-fidelity data exchange 
between several Autodesk content creation packages
Autodesk® Maya®, Autodesk® 3ds Max®, Autodesk® MotionBuilder®, Autodesk® Mudbox®, and Autodesk® Softimage®

## Running gameplay-encoder
Simply execute the gameplay-encoder command-line executable:

`Usage: gameplay-encoder [options] <file(s)>`

Note: On Linux Ubuntu 12 (64-bit), you must first install the required 32-bit libs via:

`sudo apt-get install ia32-libs`

## Building gameplay-encoder
The gameplay-encoder comes pre-built for Windows 7, MacOS X and Linux Ubuntu 12 (32-bit) in the 'bin' folder.
However, to build the gameplay-encoder yourself just open either the 
Visual Studio 2010 project "gameplay-encoder.vccproj" on Windows 7 or
XCode project "gameplay-encoder.xcodeproj" on MacOSX.
Uncomment the root CMakeList.txt for the gameplay-encoder and run standard cmake .. from build then make.

### Building with FBX Support on Windows 7 using Visual Studio 2010
- Download and install the FBX SDK for Window VS2010. (http://www.autodesk.com/fbx)
- Edit the project properties of "gameplay-encoder" for Debug
- Add Preprocessor Definition "USE_FBX" (C++/Preprocessor)
- Add the FBX SDK include directory to Additional Include Directories (C++/General)
  * Example: C:/Program Files/Autodesk/FBX/FBX SDK/2013.3/include
- Add the FBX lib directory to the Additional Library Directories (Linker/General)
  * Example: C:/Program Files/Autodesk/FBX/FBX SDK/2013.3/lib/vs2010/x86
- Add "fbxsdk-2013.3-mdd.lib"(Release) to the Additional Dependencies (Linker/Input)
  * Example: fbxsdk-2013.3-mdd.lib
- Build gameplay-encoder

### Building with FBX Support on MacOS X using XCode 4
- Download and install the FBX SDK for MacOS X (http://www.autodesk.com/fbx)
- Edit the project properties of target "gameplay-encoder".
- Add Preprocessor Macro "USE_FBX" to both Debug/Release sections. (Build Settings)
- Add the FBX include directory to Header Search Paths: (Build Settings)
  * Example: "/Applications/Autodesk/FBX SDK/2013.3/include" (Use quotes due to additional space in path)
- Add the FBX library and dependency Library/Frameworks: (Build Phases -> Link Binary with Libraries)
  * Example: /Applications/Autodesk/FBX SDK/2013.3/lib/gcc4/ub/libfbxsdk-2013.3-static.a  (Add Other)
- Build gameplay-encoder

### Building with FBX Support on Linux Ubuntu 12 (32-bit) using CMake
- Download and install the FBX SDK for MacOS X (http://www.autodesk.com/fbx)
- Edit the gameplay-encoder/CMakeLists.txt adding the following:
- Add the FBX include directory to Header Search Paths: (Build Settings)
  * Example: /usr/include/fbxsdk
- Add Preprocessor Macro to the add"-DUSE_FBX" to the end of the add_definitions(...) section of the CMakeLists.txt
- Add the FBX library path to the link_directories(...) section of the CMakeLists.txt
  * Example: /usr/lib/gcc4
- Add the FBX library to the set(APP_LIBRARIES {...} )
  * Example: fbxsdk-2013.3-static
- Add the FBX library to the library to the add_definitions(-l...) section of the CMakeLists.txt
  * Example -lfbxsdk-2013.3-static
- Build gameplay-encoder by uncommenting the last line in the gameplay/CMakeLists.txt and running the CMake build via:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
 ```

## Bundle File Format
The gameplay bundle file format is well defined in the gameplay-encoder/gameplay-bundle.txt file.

## Bundle File Loading
Bundle files can easily be loaded using the gameplay/Bundle.h which is part of the gameplay runtime framework.
